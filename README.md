Viz projects and data apps

## Goals
* Build visualizations against compelling data sets that are either personally interesting to me and/or relevant to better understanding the world and current political discourse.
* Prioritize living data sets whenever possible, and have new data be integrated automatically.
* Explore geospatial data.

## Architecture - TBD
* The `packages/web` Go package powers the web app.
* Separate cron services will populate data.
